It can be used to identify schools, various individual school programs, school districts (by office location), colleges, and libraries, among other programs. Please note that not all school programs are statutorily required to report, and many types of programs can be reported at any time of the year, so this dataset is by nature an incomplete snapshot in time.

Maintenance of these locations are a result of an ongoing project to identify current school program locations where Food and Nutrition Services Office (FNS) programs are utilized. The FNS Office is in the Minnesota Department of Education (MDE). GIS staff at MDE maintain the dataset using school program and physical addresses provided by local education authorities (LEAs) for an MDE database called "MDE ORG". MDE GIS staff track weekly changes to program locations, along with comprehensive reviews each summer. All records have been reviewed for accuracy or edited at least once since January 1, 2020.

Note that there may remain errors due to the number of program locations and inconsistency in reporting from LEAs and other organizations. In particular, some organization types (such as colleges and treatment programs) are not subject to annual reporting requirements, so some records included in this file may in fact be inactive or moved to a different location.

Note that multiple programs may occur at the same location and are represented as separate records. For example, a junior and a senior high school may be in the same building, but each has a separate record in the data layer. Users can make use of the "CLASS" and "ORGTYPE" attributes to filter and sort records according to their needs. In general, records at the same physical address will be located at the same coordinates.

This data is now available in CSV format. For that format only, OBJECTID and Shape columns are removed, and the Shape column is replaced by Latitude and Longitude columns.</abstract><purpose>The purpose of this layer is to provide location information for educational programs operating within the state of Minnesota. These locations are used by MDE to help identify where appropriate funds should be used for that school year. Note that since multiple programs may operate within the same building (at the same address), this dataset is not particularly useful as a "school building" dataset. Some, but not all, public school buildings are represented as discrete records in the related struc-school-buildings dataset.</purpose><supplinf>Minnesota</supplinf><langdata Sync="TRUE">en</langdata></descript><timeperd><current>Updated annually for the school year identified in the title.</current><timeinfo><sngdate><caldate>20231101</caldate></sngdate></timeinfo></timeperd><status><progress>Complete</progress><update>Annually</update></status><spdom><lboundng><leftbc Sync="TRUE">190972.952900</leftbc><rightbc Sync="TRUE">747256.479300</rightbc><bottombc Sync="TRUE">4817260.998400</bottombc><topbc Sync="TRUE">5468873.997700</topbc></lboundng><bounding><westbc>-97.250680</westbc><eastbc>-89.597207</eastbc><northbc>49.372570</northbc><southbc>43.444465</southbc></bounding></spdom><keywords><theme><themekey>structure, school, schools, public school, nonpublic school, non-public school, charter school, public school district office, library, libraries, educational program, college, university, school program, school programs</themekey><themekt>ISO 19115 Topic Category</themekt></theme><place><placekey>Minnesota, MN</placekey></place></keywords><accconst>None</accconst><useconst>In obtaining this data from MDE and MnGeo, it is understood that you and/or your organization have the right to use it for any purpose.

Locations are modified through a weekly process of reviewing updated program physical addresses against various sources (aerial photography, geocoding).

All other school locations (charters, nonpublic, post-secondary, etc.) were brought forward from database records at MDE and spatially located using address matching techniques and most current aerial photography. All locations have been reviewed or edited at least once since January 1, 2020. Each review uses various sources to determine location accuracy, such as address information, online mapping platforms, geocoding, aerial photography, county parcel and address data, commercial and publicly provided basemap layers, and reviews of program websites. Most records have been verified against multiple sources when determining the horizontal position.

In determining the precise location for each record, the following decision criteria were used:
1. Programs using the same physical address are co-located. (Note that some large buildings will be referenced with multiple building numbers in the address, and that some specific addresses are used to reference multiple buildings.)
2. A program "point" is placed within a parcel with the same address number (if that exists). If none exists, the remaining rules are still followed.
3. A point is placed on top of the building footprint (if visible).
4. A point is placed closest to the street with a matching name to the address, if possible within the other rules.

Since it is impossible to meet all of these rules for every record, some subjectivity exists in the placement of points.</horizpar></horizpa><vertacc><vertaccr>NA</vertaccr></vertacc></posacc><lineage><srcinfo><srcscale></srcscale></srcinfo><procstep><procdesc>For the lineage of this dataset from prior years, refer to the metadata packaged with the historical resource offerings in the MN Geospatial Commons.

Details on selected individual columns:

ORGID: A unique identifier for the program/location, used by MDE in internal databases. This is a numeric representation of the ORGTYPE, ORGNUMBER, and SCHNUMBER columns, followed at the end by '000'.
  example:  1 0001 002 000 is Rippleside Elementary
  example:   89 8016 010 000 is Aitkin Public Library
(Spaces are used in the above examples for readability; spaces are not used in the data itself.)

ORGTYPE: MDE Organization Classification, derived from MDE ORG database. Left-padded with a zero for a 2-character representation. Code reference:
  01 - Independent districts
  02 - Common districts
  03 - Special Districts (Minneapolis and South St. Paul only)
  04 - Technical college
  06 - Intermediate districts and Schools
  07 - Charter school
  08 - MDE multi-district school designation
  21 - Community colleges
  22 - State universities
  23 - University of Minnesota system
  24 - Private colleges
  25 - Community/Technical Colleges
  31 - Nonpublic School in Independent Districts
  32 - Nonpublic School in Common Districts
  33 - Nonpublic School in Special Districts
  34 - Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA) Tribal Schools
  36 - NonPublic Archdiocese
  50 - Miscellaneous Cooperatives
  51 - Vocational Cooperatives
  52 - Special Education Cooperatives
  60 - Correctional Facilities
  61 - Education Districts
  62 - Secondary Facilities Cooperatives

  82 - Regional Mgmt Information Center-RMIC
  83 - Service Cooperative-ECSU
  86 - Library Minitex Location
  88 - Library Network/Cooperative
  89 - Library

ORGNUMBER: MDE school district (or other organization) number, derived from MDE ORG database. Left-padded with zeroes for a 4-character representation.

SCHNUMBER: MDE school number (or other member identifier), derived from MDE ORG database. Left-padded with zeroes for a 3-character representation.

FORMID: A concatenation of ORGNUMBER, ORGTYPE, and SCHNUMBER, separated by dashes. This is a "formatted ID" that can be used to look up the location details in the MDE ORG reporting pages.

GISNAME: School name stored in the spatial database. Once a school is established in the database, this is generally a simplification or a more detailed description of the school, depending on which makes the record more unique. Schools that have changed names since being established in the spatial database are not always updated in this column, although annual synching is attempted. In some cases this name is an abbreviation used for ease in map labeling.

MDENAME: "Preferred" school name stored in the MDE ORG database. This data is updated more frequently, but is complementary to SCHNAME. For example, ORGIDNUM 10912051000 has a preferred name of merely "ESY" in MDE ORG, but the spatial database provides a more unique description as "Milaca ESY".

ALTNAME	: a column for storage of alternate names. Particularly useful when labeling school district offices with the short name for the school district, or libraries with a shorter name.

GISADDR: a concatenation of the ADDRESS, CITY, and ZIP columns from the spatial database (with a static "MN" inserted for geocoding/mailing purposes). Much like GISNAME vs. MDENAME, the address data stored with the spatial database may be better, worse, or just different than what is stored in MDE ORG.

MDEADDR: a similar concatenation of address fields, but from the MDE ORG database (using physical address information where available). Note that mailing addresses are stored separately in the MDE ORG database, and not reflected in this dataset.

PUBPRIV: a classification intended to demonstrate whether a program is public, or nonpublic/private
   Private or Nonpublic - All locations with ORGTYPE IN (24,31,32,33,36)
   Public - All other locations (ORGTYPE NOT IN (24,31,32,33,36))

LOCTYPE: a classification intended to demonstrate whether or not a location is the "Head" (Parent) record, such as a school district or charter office, or a "Member" (Child) record, such as an individual school program location. These designations reflect the SCHNUMBER column (000 vs non-zero), serving as a vehicle for more general categorization.

Some common uses of the above columns include:

1. School district offices have "000000" at the end of the ORGID column because they represent the Head record for schools within the district. Examples include Minneapolis (30001000000), Fridley (10013000000) or St. Paul (10625000000). Public district offices can be isolated with a query of: ORGTYPE IN ('01', '02', '03') and SCHNUMBER = '000'.

2. Charter schools - Charters are their own local education authority (LEA), operating much like a district. Therefore, there is a "Head" location for each charter license carrying the "000000" at the end of the ORGID column. There may be 2, 3, 4 or more locations based on the charter but there will always be 1 record for each charter organization and at least 1 record for a campus/school. The charters may also be housed on a single location or in several locations. To query a unique list of all Charter school organizations, query ORGTYPE = '07' And SCHNUMBER = '000'.

If you want all charter school campus locations, even when there are multiples per charter, then query ORGTYPE = '07' And SCHNUMBER &lt;&gt; '000'

GRADERANGE: Grade levels pulled from the MDE ORG database. There is wide variation within this column, and should not be used to "classify" different types of schools. (See the CLASS column.) Some examples:
   EC - Early Childhood Program
   PK - Pre-Kindergarten
   KG - Kindergarten
   1 to 12 - Grades 1 to 12

CLASS: MDE school site classification, pulled from the MDE ORG database. Available for general classifications.
    0,' ', or Blank - No site classification; generally in "Head" records, nonpublic records, or records where the organization type is not a school district.
   10 - Elem (PK-6)
   20 - Midd (5-8)
   31 - Junior High (7-8 or 7-9)
   32 - Senior High (9-12)
   33 - Secondary (7-12)
   40 - Elem/Sec Combo
   41 - ALC
   42 - ALP
   43 - Private Alternative Program
   45 - Targeted Services
   46 - Distance Learning
   50 - Special Education
   51 - Special Education ESY
   55 - Combined Spec Ed * Voc Ed Programs
   60 - Secondary Vocational Program
   70 - Delinquent Student/Correctional Program
   71 - Miscellaneous Program
   72 - Neglected Student Program, Title 1
   73 - Homeless Student Program, Title 1
   74 - Hospital/Medical Program
   75 - Telecommunications District
   76 - Educational Oversight to Private Res Care
   77 - Educational Oversight to Public Res Care
   78 - Educational Oversight to Private Day Treatment
   79 - Educational Oversight to Public Day Treatment
   82 - Community &amp; Adult Education Program
Note that because nonpublic schools are not classified with this column, there is no way to discretely identify "nonpublic elementary schools".

MAGNET: Magnet school (YES/NO)

LOCDISTID: Unique MDE ORG number for the school district within which the program is located. This is derived by location, and for public, non-charter schools, will typically reflect the ORGID of the school district, although there are exceptions. This identifier can be useful for queries such as, "how many nonpublic schools operate within district X?"

LOCDISTNAME: School district name within which the program is located; like LOCDISTID, this is derived via location.

COUNTYCODE:  State standard, 5-digit County FIPS codes, derived from where the program site is located.

COUNTYNAME: County name, derived from where the program site is located.

FED_SCHNUM: National Center for Educational Statistics (NCES) school identification number. The first 2 digits are Minnesota's state number (27). The next 5 digits are the District school designation. This will be the same for each school in that district. The final 5 numbers are the school identifier. Note that these identifiers do NOT align with MDE's organization identifiers.

Example: Aitkin School District
   Office              01 0001 000 000  FED_SCHNUM=27 02760              (2702760)
   Aitkin Sec.      01 0001 001 000  FED_SCHNUM=27 02760 00057   (270276000057)
   Rippleside El.  01 0001 002 000  FED_SCHNUM=27 02760 00059   (270276000059)

   City Academy Charter  (District)  01 4000 000 000 FED_SCHNUM=27 08955             (2708955)
   City Academy Charter  (School)  01 4000 010 000 FED_SCHNUM=27 08955 00016  (270895500016)
