A known limitation of the data is the implementation of single campus reporting by institutions.

No enrollment is reported at the Saint Paul campus or Minneapolis West Bank location. Known institutions with significant campus reporting limitations: University of Minnesota - Twin Cities (Saint Paul campus), Hennepin Technical College (Eden Prairie campus), University of St. Marys - Winona (Minneapolis Campus).
